=>Track the changes in the file:

step 1: update a file from the repository.
- check the git file status - $git status
- take any one file and make some changes(add/ remove text) in it - $vi file1.txt
- save the file and exit - press "esc" - and :wq
-now again check the status - $git status
-now you see "changes not staged for commit" - which means file is in unstaged condition


step 2: Tracking the changes in the file
- use $git diff <filename> command to compare the file in the working directory with its last staging area.
- $git diff file1.txt 

Note: if you added a line then the + statement shows the changes in the file.
      if you removed a line from the file then the -(minus) statement shows the changes in the file.

step 3: adding the file to staging area:
- $git add file1.txt --> now the file staged 
-- use - $git diff --staged file1.txt

-- to view the git commits and compare them -  use below command:
--$git log --oneline

--use git commit command to commit the changes from staged area to remote repository
--$git commit file1.txt -m "my commit"

use git push command to push the file to the main or master branch depending on your repository structure.
-$git push -u origin main or $git push -u origin master
