The git revert command is a forward-moving 'undo' operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. 
Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses 
the changes specified. Git revert is a safer alternative to git reset in regards to losing work.

--syntax - git revert <commitID>
it will undo the changes.and it also creates one new commit ID

if we revert the reverted commit ID, then it creates new commit id and the changes are as before.

git reset - will removes the changes permanently it does not create any commit
