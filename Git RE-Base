git Merge
Merge in Git allows you to join two or more development work created using git branch into a single branch.
What is git rebase?
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.

scenario:
when the master branch is not aware of the changes of the subbranch or child branch, then if we merge thet child branch with 
master branch then there will be conflict. to resolve that we need to commit to it.

during this the Merge is made - by the 'ort' stratergy.
this creates one more extra or new commit in the master branch.

Do git rebase when you want to merge the feature ot child branch with master branch to make feature branch
updated with master branch.

git rebase always do it on feature branch.

the main purpose of rebase is to arrenge the git log history in linear manner.
$git log --graph --pretty==oneline - to view the grapgical structure of log.
